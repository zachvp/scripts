# Next steps
## Development
1. Re-sync outdated files: test
2. Discover played _pruned tracks: read RB XML to determine played tracks in archive playlists;
3. Discover unplayed _pruned tracks: create playlist of all tracks not in played tracks
3. Check if existing playlist has any previously played tracks
4. Convert existing TSV playlists to structured format
5. Read Rekordbox DB for unassigned Tags in _pruned
6. Use GitHub for project management

## Manual library goals
1. Convert WAV files to AIFF
2. Refactor genres: Move House/Techno to Techno/
